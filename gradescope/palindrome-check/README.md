# Palindrome Check

In this exercise, you will write a program to determine if a given input is a palindrome. 

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. Examples include: `madam`,  `noon`, `civic`, `racecar`, `level`, `mom`, `tattarrattat`, `Ward Draw`.




## Instructions

1. In this task, you are given a JavaScript file `palindrome-check.js` which contains an incomplete function, `checkPalindrome()`. This function takes one argument `userInput`.


2. Complete the function to determine if a given input is a palindrome or not.
    - the function will display its output in the given paragraph
    - where the user input is a palindrome,  return `X is a palindrome.`
    - where the user input is a palindrome,  return `X is not a palindrome.`
         - where `X` stands for the user input, exactly as typed in.
   
- Note: Palindromes are not case sensitive. 


## Expected Output
- Given `Ward Draw` as the input. Output: `Ward Draw is a palindrome.`
- Given `noon` as input. Output: `noon is a palindrome.`
- Given `Lake` as input. Output: `Lake is not a palindrome.`
