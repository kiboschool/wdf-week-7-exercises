# Prime Number Check

In this exercise, you will write a program to determine if a given number is a prime number. You will also need to check if the given input is a number in the first place.

A prime number is an integer that is only divisible by 1 and itself.



## Instructions

1. In this task, you are given a JavaScript file `prime-check.js` which contains an incomplete function, `primeCheck()`. This function takes one argument `userInput`.
2. Complete the function to determine if a given input is a prime number or not:
- the function will return a specific string as appropriate:
    - where the user input is a prime number,  return `X is  a prime number.`
         - where `X` stands for the user input.
    - if it is not a prime number,  return `X is not a prime number.`
    - if it is not a number, return `X is not a number.`     
    - if the input is a zero `0`, or a negative number, return `Zeros and negatives are not prime numbers.`
- note that 1 is taken as a prime number in this exercise; letters and other characters are not numbers.

## Expected Output
- Given `1` as the input. Output: `1 is a prime number.`
- Given `0` as input. Output: `Zeros and negatives are not prime numbers.`
- Given `-5` as input. Output: `Zeros and negatives are not prime numbers.`
- Given `7` as input. Output: `7 is  a prime number.`
- Given `68` as input. Output: `68 is not a prime number.`
